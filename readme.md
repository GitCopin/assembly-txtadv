# Text adventure project in assembly (NASM)
- The goal was to spend some time to get a better understanding of computer architecture and a low-level programming language. I decided to make a text adventure game, or at least the beginnings of one using NASM on Linux.
- Concepts covered:
	- Calculating distance of player to objects in world using floating point math (XMM registers).
	- Loading data from files.
	- Parsing basic text commands with arguments (e.g. walk east, look north...).
	- Implementing data structures / arrays.
	- Simple collision detection.
	- Macros.
	- Learned basics of debugging assembly with gdb.
